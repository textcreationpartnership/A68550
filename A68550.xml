         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15822:154"/> theſe, there were in valour peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, all the 37 worthies of <hi>David,</hi> with many other mighty men, ſuch<note place="margin">2 Sa. 2. 22. 1 Ch. 11, &amp; 12.</note> as could vſe both the right, and left hand, for hurling ſtones and ſhoting arrowes out of a bowe, yea men of might, fit for warre, that could han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſheild and buckler, whoſe faces were like the faces of Lyons, and as ſwift as the Roes vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Afterwards when <hi>David</hi> was ſettled, and <hi>Ioab</hi> commaunded to number the people throughout the 12 Tribes, beſides <hi>Levy</hi> and <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> there were found 1570000 men that drewe ſword: and yet that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not aboue 200 miles long, and 50 miles broad, not neere the halfe of <hi>England</hi> by much. Yea when the Tribes were divided, and onely <hi>Iudah &amp; Beniamin</hi> made a kingdome, as much perhapps, as two or three of the leſſer ſhires of <hi>England,</hi> yet could <hi>Abiiah</hi> raiſe vp of choſen men 400000; <hi>Aſa</hi> had an army of 580000 all mighty men of valour; to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Amaziah</hi> his hoſt of 300000 nor of the 2600 chiefe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<note place="margin">2 Ch. 26.</note>

            <p>Laſtly, the Nation was ever in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary exerciſe by reaſon of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warres at home or abroad; In the dayes of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> of <hi>Saule</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> after the peaceable dayes of <hi>Salomon, Iſrael</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudah</hi> being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then began warres, and almoſt perpetuall betweene the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, beſides the warrs of forraigne Enemyes, the <hi>Aegyptians, Moabits, Ammonites, Edomites, Philiſtims, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians, Sirians, Aſſirians, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> vntill both kingdomes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and were led away captiue: So as this people could not be but good ſouldiers, for number many, in skill by dayly vſe exquiſite, in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour incomparable, in braue leaders, cheife Captaines and commanders,

And therefore why may not much art of Souldiary and military knowledge be collected hence at leaſt in many maine points, as well, yea why not better, then ſom other humaine writers? Seeing the relations are moſt true, matter to worke vpon plentifully admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, the warrant from God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples from the people of God, which being ſet for examples before them, will put ſouldiers in minde of the wayes of God, to moue them to ſeeke helpe and ayd of God, as thoſe did againſt their enemyes, when we goe out to battell.</p>

            <p>Thus we ſee what warrant warre hath from the Lord of Hoſts in the old Teſtament.

            <p>Moreover, that which may bee lawfull by preſſing and compulſion, may as well be lawfull for Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if there bee not very iuſt cauſe or impediment to hinder theſe. It is the iudgement of Churches refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med beyond the Sea; among whom ſome are trained vp for warre, to goe as Voluntaries.

And to conclude this, how ſhould Princes and States doe, that haue not power to preſſe, if Voluntaries might not in good conſcience offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>But here Voluntaries muſt know, and be reſolved of ſome things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the calling of a ſouldier, that it is lawfull, and that a man may

            <p n="2">2. Of the iuſtice and lawfulneſſe of the warre into which hee thruſts himſelfe, ſeeing hee goeth not by command of ſupreame authority, for this is another caſe, when men goe not of their owne pleaſure and will; but when any ſo doth, if the warre be iuſt, a man may ſerve with a good conſcience of his owne accord: but if it be apparantly vniuſt, let men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that they embrew not their hands in bloud, going Voluntaries. If Princes command, the caſe is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for private perſons may not ſit and iudge of Princes actions, not notoriouſly vniuſt as it was when Chriſtian ſouldiers vvould not draw their ſwords againſt Chriſtians vnder <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtate; though they ſerved him vvillingly againſt others. <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervants vvould not fall vpon

            <p n="5">5. Voluntaries are to weigh with themſelues what ſpecial impediments
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15822:164"/> they haue to vvithhold from going, in reſpect of ſome particular calling, requiring their owne perſon for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the duties thereof: <hi>or</hi> ſome charge of a family, vvife and children depending vpon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall being neceſſarily among them; or vvhether apparently their being at home may doe more good to their countrey, then their ſeruice in vvarre.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

            <p>Laſtly, that <hi>Voluntaries</hi> put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder the command of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to doe ſeruice, and to be ſubiect
